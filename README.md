# Context Free Grammar - Neural architecture search

This repository contains a first proposal for the implementation of a Context Free Grammar for Neural Architecture Search (CFG-NAS)

At the moment, grammar is implemented only for convolutional and linear architectures, recurrent architectures will be included in future implementations.

A complete explanation of how each grammar works is contained in relative notebooks. In general, the idea is first to generate an empty network and then fill it with required values as automatically as possible.
